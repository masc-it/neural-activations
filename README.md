Hi, I'm Mauro, ML Engineer by day, Applied Scientist by night.

This is a log of ideas and projects I have been working on in the world of neural networks and deep learning. I’ll be adding ideas here over time, it may take a while! :)

I aim to update this log every few weeks as I explore new topics.
